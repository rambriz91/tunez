# Tunez FM Radio Tuner

## Description

The Tunez app allows the user to tune through radio livestreams as if they were using a radio tuner. The app currently supports Los Angeles and San Diego. The user can choose between the two cities and tune in through any supported live stream. The app features an input range which allows the user to quickly slide between stations and tuner buttons that increments or decrements the station by 0.1.

## Tasks 

- Created a config.js file which serves as a data base for Los Angeles and San Diego radio stations.
- The app loops through the radio station data and dynamically displays information and the live stream.
- created a slider and tuner buttons that allows the user to tune between stations.
- Created a video that describes the app. See Usage for more info.
